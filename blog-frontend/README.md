Project Overview : This Blog App provides a platform where users can create, edit, and delete blog posts. Each post is linked to an author, allowing authenticated users to manage their posts. The backend, built with Spring Boot, provides RESTful APIs for user registration, authentication, and CRUD operations on posts, while the frontend, built with React, offers a user-friendly interface.
Frontend (React)
Home Page: Displays a hero section, search bar, and list of blog posts.
Search Functionality: Dynamically filters posts based on keywords.
Post Previews: Displays title, content snippet, and author information.
User Authentication: Login and registration for secure access to features.
Backend (Spring Boot)
User Registration & Authentication: JWT-based login and registration endpoints.
CRUD Operations on Posts: Create, read, update, and delete blog posts.
Role-Based Access: Ensures users can only edit/delete their own posts.

Here’s a README.md file for a full-stack blog application with both frontend (React) and backend (Spring Boot) components. This README includes setup instructions, folder structure, and project overview for both parts.

Blog App
A full-stack blog application built with React (frontend) and Spring Boot (backend). This application allows users to create, view, and manage blog posts with user authentication.

Installation
Prerequisites
Node.js for the frontend
Java 17+ for the backend
Maven for building the Spring Boot backend

Backend Setup
Navigate to the backend directory:

bash
Copy code
cd blog-app/backend
Configure application.properties: Update the src/main/resources/application.properties file with your database and JWT settings:

properties
Copy code
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/blog_app
spring.datasource.username=root
spring.datasource.password=your_password
jwt.secret=your_jwt_secret
Run the Spring Boot application:

bash
Copy code
mvn spring-boot:run
The backend will start on http://localhost:8080.

Frontend Setup
Navigate to the frontend directory:

bash
Copy code
cd blog-app/frontend
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Start the React app:

bash
Copy code
npm start
The frontend will be available at http://localhost:3000.
